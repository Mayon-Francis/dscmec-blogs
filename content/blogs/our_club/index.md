Creativity is thinking up new things and innovation is doing new things. And when both of these go hand in hand, a new era is born. 

The birth of Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) was a result of a collective effort of college and university students who were interested in Google developer technologies. Students that join a GDSC develop their expertise in a peer-to-peer learning setting and create solutions for neighbourhood businesses and their community.

Developer Students Club MEC is a community-based club that focuses on helping you progress on your journey to a successful developer. The club also helps you breathe life into your projects by aiding you with resources and guidance. In addition to giving developers trapped in a rut a boost, our club aims to connect them with a network of like-minded peers to help them tackle bigger initiatives that will improve things.

What makes our club different from others? 
---
DSC MEC helps students to put theory into practice. It is very easy to learn the theory and score in exams. But when it comes to actual execution or practice, students often tend to falter. This is where our club comes into play. We provide the best of the best resources and opportunities for our students to excel to greater heights. We conduct various events to polish their skills to the best version. Our club is open to all the students who are keen to learn and develop.
