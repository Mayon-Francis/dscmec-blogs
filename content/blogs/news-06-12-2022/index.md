## Snapchat roles out Director mode

Here comes another cool feature for all the cool people out there!!
Snapchat has now provided an option to enable advanced video tools to be available within the app- the Director mode. It enables you to activate the dual camera function, which lets you use the rear and front cameras together. It also lets you add a green screen to the video you make which could be filled with any background you like. The video pace can now be controlled using the playback speed feature. All these upgrades now available in all iOS and some Androids, will soon be available to all.

## YouTube's mobile app on iOS and Android get a makeover

YouTube has taken the next step.
It now enables watchers to pinch-zoom the video being watched. It also gets an aesthetic makeover. Color tone of the entire app would now be matching with the video being watched. This effect called the "ambient work" that uses "dynamic color sampling" will be available on both desktop and mobile. And the dark theme gets even darker! 
Now say goodbye to the disturbing video links amidst a video, which will now be just a button. With all these you will definitely find YouTube a next level experience.
